Instructions to Compile:

The program should be executed in an IDLE (python GUI)

By default:
1) The code for performing 'AllMatches' & 'HierarchicalClustering' is enabled
			Note: 	a) The directory name for 'AllMatches' must be 'images' and 
					b) The directory & the python file should be placed under the same parent directory ("c:/cv/images" & "c:/cv/hw3.py")
2) The keypoints function is used by other functions, so it has only the SURF enabled. SIFT and writing to files has been disabled.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) To execute only Keypoints with SIFT and SURF:
	Uncomment: lines 19-31 (inclusive), 39-41 (inclusive), 45-46, and 225
	Comment: lines 43(return statement), 226-228 (inclusive)
	
	Pass the required image (image should be present in the same directory as the python file) and run the code
	
2) To execute Only Matching, keep the default settings:
	Uncomment only line 226 (matching function) 
	
	Pass the required images (images should be present in the same directory as the python file) and run the code

3) To execute AllMatches, execute in the default settings. if only 'AllMatches' is needed without 'HierarchicalClustering' then
	Comment line 228 (hClustering function)

4) Only 'HierarchicalClustering' CAN NOT run separately, it needs a Distance Matrix which is obtained using 'AllMatches' function.
	This is the default settings
